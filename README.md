# RealtimeKeyboardNotation
JUCE GUI application that simultaneously displays keyboard and staff notation visualizations of MIDI messages in real time. For the keyboard visualization, all pressed notes are highlighted. For staff notation, all pressed notes are presented as a chord (timing info is discarded).

Please note that this is a personal project that is not guaranteed (or intended) to function on any machine besides mine. In fact, I'm not even giving you the images I'm using! Feel free to use this as reference code if you want to create your own MIDI visualizations, however.
